PROBLEM: This is yet another in a long list of ACSL code programs. You would think we
would have run out of them by now. In this program you will be given a letter to encode. The
difference here is that different rules are used for different letters and the counting process can
cause you to wrap around the alphabet. Using the numerical value of each letter (A=1, B=2, …
Z= 26) the rules are as follows:
If the letter is between the
given letters, inclusive:

The number of letters to count is given by:
A – E Multiply its numerical value by 2
F – J Divide its numerical value by 3. Multiply the integerremainder by 5
K – O Divide its numerical value by 4. Multiply the integer part of the quotient by 8.
P – T Multiply the sum of the digits of its numerical value by 10
U- Z Find the largest integer factor of its numerical value less than the value itself. Multiply it by 12.
